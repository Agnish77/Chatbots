This code outlines a process for building and training a neural network model to answer questions based on given stories. It begins by loading and exploring the data, which is stored in pickle files and includes stories, questions, and answers. The data is preprocessed to create sequences of words for the stories and questions, and these sequences are padded to a consistent length. A tokenizer is used to convert words into numerical indices, and the answers are one-hot encoded. The model is a sequence-to-sequence architecture using embedding layers, LSTM layers, and a dot product for attention mechanisms. The model is compiled with categorical crossentropy loss and trained on the dataset for 120 epochs, with validation performed on a separate test set. However, the training accuracy and loss metrics suggest that the model is struggling to learn effectively, as the validation accuracy remains stagnant around 50%.
